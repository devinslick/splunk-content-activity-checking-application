Place custom scripts here if needed in the future:
- Python scripts for custom commands
- Custom search commands
- Modular inputs
- Custom alert actions

Currently, CACA uses pure SPL and REST API calls for maximum compatibility
with all Splunk deployment types (Enterprise, Cloud, etc.)

No custom scripts are required for core functionality.
