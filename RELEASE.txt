## Version 0.0.1 - Initial Beta Release

### 🎯 What is CACA?

CACA helps Splunk administrators and content creators answer critical questions:
- "Is anyone using this dashboard I built?"
- "Which dashboards are most critical to our users?"
- "Is this dashboard performing well or throwing errors?"
- "Which dashboards are safe to archive or delete?"

- ✅ 3 dashboards (Leaderboard, Poop Deck, Details)
- ✅ 4 scheduled searches for data collection
- ✅ 5 search macros for easy querying
- ✅ Metrics index configuration
